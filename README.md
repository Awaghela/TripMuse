# TripMuse 🧳✨  
_Pre-trip mood, packing, notes — all offline and exportable._

TripMuse is a personal pre-trip companion web app.  
Before you even start building an itinerary, TripMuse helps you:

- Capture the **vibe** of your upcoming trip using AI ("what this trip will feel like")
- Generate a **smart packing list** based on destination, season, and mood
- Save a **pre-trip journal** of promises (food to try, places to see, people to meet)
- Export everything into a **one-click PDF trip brief** you can keep on your phone offline

All data is stored locally in the browser (no account required), and you can generate everything even in airplane mode.

## Why TripMuse?

Travel planning apps are great at logistics:
routes, reservations, maps, timelines.

TripMuse focuses on **what happens just before that**:
the emotional prep, the intention, the “why I’m excited for this trip.”

It answers:
- “What do I want this weekend to *feel* like?”
- “What do I need to remember to pack?”
- “What did I promise myself I’d do when I get there?”
- “Can I keep this all with me on the plane even if I have no service?”

TripMuse is built as an offline-first, privacy-first companion to that moment.

##  Core Features

###  AI Moodboard
You enter:
- Destination (e.g. “San Diego”)
- Dates (e.g. “Oct 26 – Oct 30”)
- Vibe / intention (e.g. “Relaxation”, “Adventure”, “Culture & Food”)

TripMuse generates:
- A short, sensory “trip vibe” paragraph (e.g. “the warm California sun wraps around you…”)
- A curated visual collage using destination / vibe (local image assets, no remote calls)

This is about emotionally setting the tone for your trip — not just logistics.

---

###  Smart Packing
TripMuse creates a packing checklist grouped by category:
- Clothing
- Toiletries
- Tech / Essentials
- Documents / Money

The list adapts to your vibe and general climate (e.g. “swimsuit + breathable tops” for Relaxation in San Diego vs “hiking layers / trail shoes” for Adventure).

You can:
- Check off items
- Add custom items
- All of it is persisted in `localStorage` as structured JSON

This JSON is later used in the PDF export.

---

###  Private Trip Journal
Before you leave, there’s a simple journal where you jot down:
- “Watch the sunset at La Jolla Cove”
- “Eat fish tacos”
- “Message Jess when I land”
- “Buy something small for my parents”

This is saved **only to your browser** (`localStorage`) and never sent anywhere.

The journal textarea is:
- Larger and comfortable to type in
- Resizable (you can drag to make it bigger)
- Usable offline / in airplane mode

---

###  1-Click Trip Brief (PDF Export)
TripMuse assembles everything into a printable travel brief:
- Trip summary (destination, dates, vibe)
- The AI “trip vibe” paragraph
- Structured packing list (by category)
- Your personal notes / journal

You get a one-click `Download Trip Brief (.pdf)` button.
Under the hood this uses `jsPDF` and `jspdf-autotable` to render styled sections.

The PDF is designed for offline use: something you can keep in iCloud Files, Google Drive, or literally print.

---

## Tech Stack

**Frontend / App**
- Next.js (React)
- TailwindCSS for styling
- Framer Motion for subtle animation
- Local state + `localStorage` / `sessionStorage`

**AI / Generation**
- Ollama (local LLM, e.g. `llama3`) via `/api` routes  
  - The vibe description and packing suggestions are generated by prompting Ollama  
  - `stream: false` for simplicity

**Export**
- jsPDF
- jspdf-autotable (for packing tables / sections)

**Storage model**
- No account, no auth  
- All user data is stored in-browser only  
- Works offline after first load because it doesn't depend on remote APIs except your local Ollama

## Privacy / Offline

TripMuse is built deliberately as:
- **Local-first**
- **No account required**
- **Airplane-mode compatible**

All of these:
- Destination
- Dates
- Vibe (“Relaxation / Adventure / etc.”)
- Packing list
- Journal notes
- AI-generated vibe text

…live in browser storage. Nothing is uploaded or synced to a server.

When you generate the final Trip Brief PDF, it’s assembled in the browser using that local data and immediately saved to disk. No network calls.

This is critical for travelers:
- No roaming data required  
- Still works mid-flight  
- Nothing personal goes into a cloud

---

## Getting Started (Local Dev)

### 1. Clone and install
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/tripmuse.git
cd tripmuse
npm install
```

### 2. Run Ollama (for AI generation)
TripMuse calls a local LLM via the Ollama API to generate:
- The sensory “trip vibe” paragraph
- Suggested packing categories/items

You’ll need:
- [Ollama](https://ollama.ai/) installed locally
- A model pulled (ex: `llama3`)

Pull a model (example):
```bash
ollama pull llama3
```

Start Ollama (it usually runs on `http://localhost:11434` by default).

### 3. Dev server
```bash
npm run dev
```

Your app should be available at:
```text
http://localhost:3000
```

### 4. Pages to try
1. Go to `/`
2. Start a “trip” by entering destination / dates / vibe
3. Generated moodboard at `/moodboard`
4. Packing list at `/packing` (this should save to `localStorage`)
5. Add journal notes at `/journal`
6. Export PDF at `/export`

## How Data Flows

- **Destination, Dates, Vibe**
  - Saved to `localStorage` as:
    - `tripmuse-destination`
    - `tripmuse-dates`
    - `tripmuse-vibe`

- **Vibe Text (AI paragraph)**
  - Saved to `sessionStorage` as `tripmuse-vibeText`
  - Generated in `/api/vibe` using Ollama

- **Packing**
  - Generated in `/api/packing`
  - Saved to `localStorage` as `tripmuse-packing` (JSON object of categories -> items)

- **Journal Text**
  - Saved to `localStorage` as `tripmuse-journal`

- **Export**
  - `/export` loads all of the above, builds a PDF using jsPDF

This means you can refresh the browser and pick up where you left off without logging in.

---

## PDF Output

The PDF Trip Brief includes:
- Title (`TripMuse – Trip Brief`)
- Trip summary (Destination, Dates, Vibe)
- **Trip Vibe** (the AI-generated sensory/intention paragraph)
- **Packing List** grouped by category — each item printed in a bullet-like row
- **Personal Notes** — your journal block

It's designed to be something you can:
- Save to your phone Files app
- Send to friends
- Print
- Use offline on the plane

## 🗺 Future Ideas / Roadmap

1. **Weather-aware packing.**  
   Hit a weather API for trip dates and feed that into the packing prompt ("bring a light rain shell, it's going to drizzle").

2. **Friend / group mode.**  
   Share packing + journal so everyone going on a group trip can collaborate; merge and dedupe packing lists.

3. **Sync into itinerary tools.**  
   Push the “Trip Vibe” and “Must-do’s” into an itinerary in Wanderlog — so emotional intent and logistics live together.

4. **Document reminders.**  
   Passport validity, visa warning, vaccine proof, SIM card reminders, etc., based on destination.

5. **Printable mini “wallet card.”**  
   Distill important medical info / emergency contacts / hotel address in local language.

##  Dev Notes

- The UI uses TailwindCSS for fast iteration and theming.
- Dark mode is handled by toggling a `dark` class on `<html>` and remembering it in `localStorage` (`tripmuse-theme`).
- Background is a soft blue→white radial/linear combo intentionally styled to evoke Wanderlog’s visual language without directly copying it.
- Components are built to look like “cards”: blurred white panels with rounded corners and drop shadows. This matches how modern travel and planning apps present information chunks.
